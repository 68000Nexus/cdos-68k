_______________________________________________________________________________
 
     This diskette is organized into three subdirectories:

     DRV_SRC -- Contains all of the CDOS 68K driver modules in source form.
     In addition to the files listed in the release note, this subdirectory
     contains the file CPASM.BAT which is used to process the RAMDISK driver
     source component BTOOLS.PS.  To produce a loadable ramdisk driver, the 
     linker output file RDD.68K must be processed by the CRUNCH utility.
     
     SYS_SRC -- Contains all of the CDOS 68K system configuration modules
     in source form.  Also, the file listed in the release note as OMMUA.S
     is named OMMUA.PS.  Files with the file extension "PS" are assembler
     files that use the #include directive and must be processed by the C
     preprocessor CP68.68k.

     HEADERS -- Contains all of the .h files used to compile the sources 
     in DRV_SRC and SYS_SRC.

     In order to conserve disk space, some of the .h files that are used to
compile the SYSLIB sources may not have been duplicated on this disk.  Check 
Developer Kit Disk 5 for additional .h files.
