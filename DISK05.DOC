6 August 1986                                              CDOS 68K, ver. 1.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This diskette contains the sources, linkable library, submit files,
and batch files for a library that will allow you to write almost normal 'C' 
programs that will execute under CDOS version 1.2 for the MC68000 family of 
microprocessors.  In addition to the files listed in the Release Note, the
following files are provided on this diskette:
     
     SYSLINK  BAT		COMPL68  BAT
     LD       C			BUILDL68 BAT
     STD40    H			LDIV     S
     LIBCALLS H                 LREM     S
     OSIF     O			LMUL     S
     GSTART   O			STRNCMP  C
     GSTART   C                 STRCAT   C
     OSIF     S			STRCPY   C                 

     The following files listed in the Release Note have not been provided:
     
     CRCK.C
     QATOOLS.C
     PRINTF.C
     JPRT.C

    
          This library is designed for use with the CP/M 68K C compiler and 
contains the necessary 'C' functions to permit extremely sophisticated 
system programs however, it is by no means complete.  K&R standards were not 
strictly adhered to.  Two sample programs have been included as an illustra-
tion of what can be done with this library and to allow you to learn from 
what we have learned. 

SUBMIT FILES:
     
        The submit files, which were originally provided for use in a CP/M 
        68K crosss-developement mode, compile and link the library source 
        into the file SYSLIB.L68.  Use the the batch files of the same names
        under CDOS 68K.  

        The submit files are meant to be more than just tools; they are
        also valuable examples of how things can be accomplished.  Feel free
        to study and modify them to suit your needs.

        COMPL68.SUB  -- This file will compile and assemble all 
        of the source modules for SYSLIB.L68.   

        BUILDL68.SUB -- Invokes AR68 to archive all of the .O files
        to create the library.

BATCH FILE:

        COMPL68.BAT -- See COMPL68.SUB

        BUILDL68.BAT -- See BUILDL68.SUB

        SYSLINK.BAT -- An example of the linker command line to link
        a program with the system library.

SAMPLE PROGRAMS:

        CVT40.C   -- A   simple  program  to   perform   numeric 
        conversions.   Hexadecimal  numbers  are proceeded by  a 
        '0x',  octal numbers are prefixed with '0',  and decimal 
        numbers  begin  with the decimal  digit.   This  program 
        demonstrates the use of the SYSLIB functions.

	LD.C 	  -- Does S_LOOKUPS on the Disk File Table looking
	for sub-directories.  LD may be invoked with or without a
	argument.  Wild cards are allowed.
