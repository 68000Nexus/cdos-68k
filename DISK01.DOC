_______________________________________________________________________________
 

     In this release of Concurrent DOS 68K the operating system's function-
ality and characteristics are defined in two phases;  1) the initial hardware
configuration and the user environment are defined during system generation
(when the CDOS.SYS file is created) by the VMCONFIG.C file, and 2) at system
load time via the files CONFIG.BAT and AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Be sure to edit these
files to correspond to any changes you make to your hardware or software
organization.

     This version of Concurrent DOS is shipped with a system that includes 
the CP/M 68K front end and may be booted from either the floppy or the hard 
disk.  Instructions for booting from the hard disk are included in the 
Concurrent DOS for the Motorola MC68000 Release Note. 

     For the VME/10 the window manager keys are as follows:
