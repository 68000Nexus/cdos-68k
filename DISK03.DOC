U_TOOLS               Remainder of the UNIX-like tools.  Documented in the 
                      PROGRAMMER'S UTILITIES GUIDE SUPPLEMENT.  

TOOLS                 CP/M 68K programming tools; requires the CP/M 68k 
                      front-end be present.  The utilities COMBINE and
                      EXPAND are CDOS native mode utilities that are 
                      useful for conserving disk space used to store
                      small files.  The typical naming convention is to
                      give COMBINE'd files the extension ARC.  All of these
                      programs are documented in the PROGRAMMER'S UTILITIES
                      GUIDE.

SAMPLE                Some of the Window Manager source is provided as an
                      example of a program that implements windowing tech-
                      niques, message passing, and process creation.
