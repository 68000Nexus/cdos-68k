_______________________________________________________________________________
 
     This diskette is organized into two subdirectories:

     DEBUGGER -- Contains all of the files necessary to debug a CDOS 68K
     system under CP/M 68K.  Instructions for using the cross-environment
     debugger are provided in the CDOS 68K Release Note.

     SYS_GEN -- Organized into two subdirectories:

          TOOLS --  Contains .BAT and .COM files to link a new system file.
          The different permutations of hardware and features are described
          in the CDOS 68K Release Note.  To link a new system file you must
          increase the stack size of LINK68.68K to F000h with the following
          command:

               SS -sf000 link68.68k

          OBJECTS -- Contains some of the objects files required to link a new
          system file.

NOTE:  The files BASE.O, COFFLOAD.O, and COMMAND.O are on Developer Kit
Supplement Disk 2 instead of Developer Kit Disk 3 as shown in the CDOS
68K Release Note.
