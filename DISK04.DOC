     This disk contains the assembler, C compiler, linkers, debugger, and
other programming tools and utilities.  These tools and utilities are all 
documented in the PROGRAMMER'S UTILITIES GUIDE.  Supplemental discussions
of assembly language programming conventions, file load formats, and the use
of the COFF and CRUNCH utilities are contained in the CONCURRENT DOS 
SUPPLEMENT FOR COMPUTERS BASED ON THE MOTOROLA MC68000 FAMILY OF 
MICROPROCESSORS.

     The C library contains CP/M 68K code rather than CDOS 68K native mode 
code and therefore, the executable files produced can only be run on CDOS 68K
systems that include the CP/M 68K front end.  CDOS native mode C programs can
be produced by using the SYSLIB.L68 library included on Developer Kit Disk 5.
